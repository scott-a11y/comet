# Shared Learnings

This file tracks learnings, mistakes, and insights that apply **across all projects** in the Boris Cherny multi-agent workflow system.

## Purpose

- **Cross-Project Knowledge**: Lessons learned here should be applied to Comet, HD75, Revive-Cabinet-App, and any future projects
- **Agent Learning**: AI agents read this file at the start of each session to avoid repeating mistakes
- **Manual Sync Required**: When you update this file in one project, manually copy it to all other projects

## Format

Each entry should include:
- **Date**: When the learning occurred
- **Context**: What task/feature was being worked on
- **Issue**: What went wrong or what was learned
- **Solution**: How it was fixed or should be handled in the future
- **Projects Affected**: Which repos this applies to
